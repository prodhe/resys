# Re:sys

Webapp in jQuery that manages bookings and layout for an event.

Intended for the hoster of the event. No registration needed and
the import/export is a simple HTML-dump of the main area.

In Swedish (although the comments are in English), because it was
written in a day for a family member. As with alot of my other
repositories, I might change that one day.
